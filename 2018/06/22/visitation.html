    <p>Today, we visited the Agathians Shelter along with the other group to return
them the fund we raised during the fundraising events. The itenary of the
visitation also includes return the leftover merchandize items that did not to
be sold and carry out an activity with the kids and have a meal with them.</p>

<p>After we reached the Agathians Shelter, we were greeted warmly by the staff. We
pass the fund to the staff and merchandize items to them. The stock and fund are then cross checked to ensure the amount of items sold, the fund and the stock returned are tallied.</p>

<p>After everything is in order, we went to visit the children. We have decided
early on that we would conduct an origami session with the children as it would
be fun and interesting for them considering their age.</p>

<p>During the origami session, Shi Hern was the one who lead and teach them how to
make frog. While a few of the children were paying attention on learning how to
make a frog, some of them would like to learn how to make planes and boat.
Hence, some of us make planes and boat with them. To us, their happiness is
our priority in the activity.</p>

<p>Around 4 pm, the tea time had arrived and we were called for a meal. Due to the
limited space in the dining area, we ate our meal seperately with the children.
After the meal, the children were called back to continue with their daily
activities. After they left, we cleaned up the area and take a group photo
together. We also thanked the staff for having us.</p>

<p>Despite feeling tired after having fun with the children, we all felt fulfilled
and happy to have the opportunity to contribute something to the society.</p>
