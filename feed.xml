them the fund we raised during the fundraising events. The itenary of the
visitation also includes return the leftover merchandize items that did not to
be sold and carry out an activity with the kids and have a meal with them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we reached the Agathians Shelter, we were greeted warmly by the staff. We
pass the fund to the staff and merchandize items to them. The stock and fund are then cross checked to ensure the amount of items sold, the fund and the stock returned are tallied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After everything is in order, we went to visit the children. We have decided
early on that we would conduct an origami session with the children as it would
be fun and interesting for them considering their age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the origami session, Shi Hern was the one who lead and teach them how to
make frog. While a few of the children were paying attention on learning how to
make a frog, some of them would like to learn how to make planes and boat.
Hence, some of us make planes and boat with them. To us, their happiness is
our priority in the activity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 4 pm, the tea time had arrived and we were called for a meal. Due to the
limited space in the dining area, we ate our meal seperately with the children.
After the meal, the children were called back to continue with their daily
activities. After they left, we cleaned up the area and take a group photo
together. We also thanked the staff for having us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling tired after having fun with the children, we all felt fulfilled
and happy to have the opportunity to contribute something to the society.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today, we visited the Agathians Shelter along with the other group to return them the fund we raised during the fundraising events.

pre-briefing session on how to sell, and pep talk to strive towards our
goal of bringing a hearty amounts of funds for the Agathians Shelter.
Throughout the 3 days from 9am-4pm we sold items at our booth which
was located at Sunway Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also decorated our booth and put up signs to make sure that everything
was presentable and the message portrayed was loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day, one lady approach us and gave us some advice on how
we can decorate our booth and display our items better to attract people
attraction. After listening to her advice, we rearrage our booth again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the morning, we make a few sales. The outcome was not as good as
expected. Hence, we decided to walk around campus to ask if any students
wanted to purchase the water tumblers or the marvel keychains. Charis and Raeka
asked around but barely made any sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;
    Charis and Raeka making sales

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some cold approach by Charis and Raeka, Charis suggested that we can go
to ask lecturers and classrooms to ask for donations. We all agreed with her
suggestion and go ahead with her plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;
    Qi Hao and Charis selling keychains

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charis, Raeka, Qi Hao, Chanan and Kai Wern visited each lecturer who are in
their office and ask for donation in return of merchandize item such as
water tumblers or keychains. Through this approach we manage to raise around
RM 200. A very big thank you to all the kind hearted lecturers, staffs and
students.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 4 pm, Shi Hern, Li Sheng and Cuok Syen help cleaning up the
merchandize items and keep it into their cars. This end the first day
of our fundraising event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the event, as usual we decorate our booth in the morning
and start selling the item at around 9 am. Melissa and Chanan were responsible
of the booth for that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of day 2 didn’t not turn out as well as we wish it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day of the event, we were fortunate to be able to use the
Boulevard store as our booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day three were a little special to us as, there was a student who happily made
a RM50 donation, without any return,  which really lifted our spirits. In day
three, surprisingly we managed to sell 4 books which help us increase our total
fundraise by around RM 55.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 4pm, we start packing up and thereby end our fundraising event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to pull together around RM500 of sales through the assorted items
which includes books, clothing, keychains, and waterbottles.
The waterbottles and keychains proved to be the best sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every item sold and the price were tallied in our account sheet and we made
sure that sales account and stock number are balanced. We learned a valuable lesson
in teamwork, and working for others out of the pure initiative to help others in
need regardless of money, and we believe that is a lesson and memory we will always
keep in our hearts which made us eager to meet the children of the Agathians Shelter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">So, the fundrasing session begins and all of us gather together for a pre-briefing session on how to sell, and pep talk to strive towards our goal of bringing a hearty amounts of funds for the Agathians Shelter.

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also updated Agathians Shelter on the event dates and we have
proposed our date of collection of the marchandize. We also enquire about
the complete information of the merchandize items such as the price and
the quantity of the items. Other than that, we also proposed our date
visit them to interact with the children and return the fund we will be
raising during the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we had prepared the donation entry document to be
print out during the event. We also prepared the format of the
Excel sheet where we record the total merchandize collected and
the transaction during the sales of the merchandize items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The members of the other group had also been working on the preparation
of the board.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After our first meeting, we have now finalized the roster during the fundraising event from 4th June to 6th June.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Planning</title><link href="/community-service-2018/2018/05/11/planning.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Planning" /><published>2018-05-11T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-05-11T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/community-service-2018/2018/05/11/planning</id><content type="html" xml:base="/community-service-2018/2018/05/11/planning.html">&lt;p&gt;It had been a long week since we last updated our blog.
We have done quite a number of tasks in this week.
First of all, we have been keeping in contact with Agathians
Shelter about the merchandises that we will be selling and
we have gotten a list from them. As we are told, we are about to sell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Books: Fiction and non-fiction (non-religious, non-politics)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Water tumblers / bottles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keychains&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ladies Blouse, short pants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unisex Collared and round neck T-shirts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Men Formal / Casual Shirts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the list of merchandises, we started to work on the proposal
to request for a venue in university. With the complete details
provided, we successfully obtained a booth in boulevard.
Considering the time to fetch the merchandises and other preparations,
we are planning to open the booth from 4th June to 6th June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;

for fundraising event&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past weeks, we had a  meeting to discuss about
the preparation needed for the fundraising event
and allocation of responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the discussion, we had identified a few possible problems we
might face during the fundraising event. Since this is the first time
we help raising funds, we should be very careful when it comes to
handling the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;
    Qi Hao and Kai Wern having discussion how to resolve the problem
  &lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;

      &lt;img class=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;/community-service-2018/assets/image/photo1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Qi Hao and Kai Wern having discussion how to resolve the problem&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to resolve this issue, we plan to document every single transaction
of the merchandiseand donation to keep track of our fund we raised and
to ensure that we have a clean and transparent record on throught the
fundraising event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that we do not accidentally miscalculated the fund raised,
we decided to assign a treasurer to be responsible on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the discussion, we also found out that we need a board that
can grab attention of people during the collection of donation and
spread awareness about this event. The members from the other group,
Raeka and Charis, had volunteered themselves to prepare the board,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board will be equiped with necessary information such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The purpose of the fundraising event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The background of Agathians Shelter, the orphanage home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the donation will be used on aiding the opreation of the orphanage
home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;

fundraising event&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had a discussion with the other group on the allocation of the
timeslots during the fundraising event as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event lasts 3 days, from 4th of June to 6th of June, and the
activities during the fundraising events can be summarized as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Duty at booth to sell merchandize and collection of donation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk around the campus to spread awareness and collection of donation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a brief overview on the work required during the events, we figured
out that we need at least 2 people take care of the booth and around 2
people walk around the campus to collect donation and spread awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since some of us have classes to attend during some of these days,
we share our timetable with each other and discuss who will be responsible
of those duties for the event. After a brief discussion, each of us have a
rough idea on who can be on duty on which day. To finalize the allocation
of timeslot during the fundraising event, Qi Hao created an Google Sheets
to allow other members to specify their duty time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the meeting, we distribute the tasks accordingly to prevent
overwhelming work needed to be done by an individual alone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It had been a long week since we last updated our blog.

As we are told, we are about to sell:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Initial Thoughts</title><link href="/community-service-2018/2018/04/26/initial-thoughts.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Initial Thoughts" /><published>2018-04-26T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-04-26T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/community-service-2018/2018/04/26/initial-thoughts</id><content type="html" xml:base="/community-service-2018/2018/04/26/initial-thoughts.html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since we have started community service, we have been researching about orphanage and Agathians Shelter. After researching about it, we are suprised that there are actually a large amount of orphans. We truly
understand the purpose of Agathians Shelter and we hoped that we can
provide our hands in helping to fulfil all the essential needs of a
child’s life such as shelter, food, education, care, attention and
love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believed that saving children from the streets should not
and could never be an one-man task. Therefore, we have accepted their
proposed method to help them which is through fund raising in Sunway
University. We clearly understand that we are not contributing a lot
in helping these children but we simply hoped they can be one step
closer to their dream with our help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we as a team, also realised how lucky are us to have
parents. It is something that we have always take it for granted. Come
to think of it, having parents around us and accompany us in our
journey of life is something that we should always be grateful for.
They raise us up. They provide us education. They hope we achieve
our potential. They hope the best of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to make friends with the children of Agathians
Shelter. We hope that our visitation to the welfare home  can help
us understand circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really look forward to raise fund for them. We wish that we could
spread the awareness to at least 300 Sunway University students, so
that more people are aware of Agathians Shelter welfare home and their
needs. Hopefully, we can raise a total of RM 1000 and contribute it to
Agathians Shelter as their operating fees.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Ever since we have started community service, we have been researching about orphanage and Agathians Shelter.
