title: Initial Thoughts
---
Ever since we have started community service, we have been researching about orphanage and Agathians Shelter. After researching about it, we are suprised that there are actually a large amount of orphans. We truly
understand the purpose of Agathians Shelter and we hoped that we can
provide our hands in helping to fulfil all the essential needs of a
child's life such as shelter, food, education, care, attention and
love.

We believed that saving children from the streets should not
and could never be an one-man task. Therefore, we have accepted their
proposed method to help them which is through fund raising in Sunway
University. We clearly understand that we are not contributing a lot
in helping these children but we simply hoped they can be one step
closer to their dream with our help.

On the other hand, we as a team, also realised how lucky are us to have
parents. It is something that we have always take it for granted. Come
to think of it, having parents around us and accompany us in our
journey of life is something that we should always be grateful for.
They raise us up. They provide us education. They hope we achieve
our potential. They hope the best of us.

We are looking forward to make friends with the children of Agathians
Shelter. We hope that our visitation to the welfare home  can help
us understand circumstances.

We really look forward to raise fund for them. We wish that we could
spread the awareness to at least 300 Sunway University students, so
that more people are aware of Agathians Shelter welfare home and their
needs. Hopefully, we can raise a total of RM 1000 and contribute it to
Agathians Shelter as their operating fees.
