After our first meeting, we have now finalized the roster during the
fundraising event from 4th June to 6th June.

We have also updated Agathians Shelter on the event dates and we have
proposed our date of collection of the marchandize. We also enquire about
the complete information of the merchandize items such as the price and
the quantity of the items. Other than that, we also proposed our date
visit them to interact with the children and return the fund we will be
raising during the event.

Meanwhile, we had prepared the donation entry document to be
print out during the event. We also prepared the format of the
Excel sheet where we record the total merchandize collected and
the transaction during the sales of the merchandize items.

The members of the other group had also been working on the preparation
of the board.
