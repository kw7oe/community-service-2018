So, the fundrasing session begins and all of us gather together for a
pre-briefing session on how to sell, and pep talk to strive towards our
goal of bringing a hearty amounts of funds for the Agathians Shelter.
Throughout the 3 days from 9am-4pm we sold items at our booth which
was located at Sunway Boulevard.

We also decorated our booth and put up signs to make sure that everything
was presentable and the message portrayed was loud and clear.

On the first day, one lady approach us and gave us some advice on how
we can decorate our booth and display our items better to attract people
attraction. After listening to her advice, we rearrage our booth again.

During the morning, we make a few sales. The outcome was not as good as
expected. Hence, we decided to walk around campus to ask if any students
wanted to purchase the water tumblers or the marvel keychains. Charis and Raeka
asked around but barely made any sales.

After some cold approach by Charis and Raeka, Charis suggested that we can go
to ask lecturers and classrooms to ask for donations. We all agreed with her
suggestion and go ahead with her plan.

Charis, Raeka, Qi Hao, Chanan and Kai Wern visited each lecturer who are in
their office and ask for donation in return of merchandize item such as
water tumblers or keychains. Through this approach we manage to raise around
RM 200. A very big thank you to all the kind hearted lecturers, staffs and
students.

At around 4 pm, Shi Hern, Li Sheng and Cuok Syen help cleaning up the
merchandize items and keep it into their cars. This end the first day
of our fundraising event.

On the second day of the event, as usual we decorate our booth in the morning
and start selling the item at around 9 am. Melissa and Chanan were responsible
of the booth for that day.

The result of day 2 didn't not turn out as well as we wish it to be.

On the third day of the event, we were fortunate to be able to use the
Boulevard store as our booth.

Day three were a little special to us as, there was a student who happily made
a RM50 donation, without any return,  which really lifted our spirits. In day
three, surprisingly we managed to sell 4 books which help us increase our total
fundraise by around RM 55.

### Summary

We managed to pull together around RM500 of sales through the assorted items
which includes books, clothing, keychains, and waterbottles.
The waterbottles and keychains proved to be the best sellers.

Every item sold and the price were tallied in our account sheet and we made
sure that sales account and stock number are balanced. We learned a valuable lesson
in teamwork, and working for others out of the pure initiative to help others in
need regardless of money, and we believe that is a lesson and memory we will always
keep in our hearts which made us eager to meet the children of the Agathians Shelter.
